00:00:02.182 --> 00:00:05.044
Hi everybody! So here is a demo of our visualization, 

00:00:05.044 --> 00:00:08.763
You first get to our webpage, and you go onto the header and click "Visualization,"

00:00:08.763 --> 00:00:11.942
which is going to jump down to this part of our webpage.

00:00:11.942 --> 00:00:15.103
Um, we are first presented with our bar charts that represent

00:00:15.103 --> 00:00:17.254
different race and ethnic groups by sex

00:00:17.254 --> 00:00:19.102
and their representation in different STEM fields.

00:00:19.102 --> 00:00:22.228
Um, so for example, let's say I wanted to 

00:00:22.228 --> 00:00:25.825
just explore this bar chart, I would hover over, for example

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:28.124
Latino Female, and I would see that there are about 

00:00:28.124 --> 00:00:33.267
79,000 Latino Females in the United States within STEM fields.

00:00:33.267 --> 00:00:36.680
Notice, that American Indian (Indigenous Americans) and Native Hawaiian

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.024
race and ethnic groups do not have any bars,  this does not mean that there are 0 American Indian 

00:00:41.024 --> 00:00:43.573
men and women, and Native Hawaiian men and women, 

00:00:43.674 --> 00:00:45.522
in STEM fields in the United States, 

00:00:45.522 --> 00:00:47.084
it means that there was an issue with the data, 

00:00:47.084 --> 00:00:50.500
um, and that is addressed in our note here. 

00:00:50.618 --> 00:00:53.021
which a user can easily see. 

00:00:53.021 --> 00:00:56.777
So let's say I wanted to explore White Female, 

00:00:56.777 --> 00:01:02.000
I can see that 918,000 White Females are in STEM fields in the United States. 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.460
So I'm going to click on that.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.540
And now I can see a breakdown of a number of different 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.287
STEM fields, um, among White Females, and grouped by different disability statuses.

00:01:12.287 --> 00:01:17.172
So, we have those without a disability, and with a disability in Social Scientists, for instance

00:01:17.172 --> 00:01:19.158
Let's say I'm interested in Mathematical Scientists, 

00:01:19.158 --> 00:01:24.189
um, we see that those with a disability, um, are significantly less than those without a disability

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:26.294
We have count here on the y-axis

00:01:26.294 --> 00:01:28.826
Let's say I wanted to explore a little bit further, 

00:01:28.826 --> 00:01:32.394
Mathematical Scientists, I can click on those without a disability, 

00:01:32.394 --> 00:01:37.411
and see a better representation of how those with and without disability compare

00:01:37.411 --> 00:01:41.117
in Mathematical Scientists as a White woman.

00:01:41.117 --> 00:01:44.160
So I can just analyze that.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:52.728
Let's say I wanted to go back, I can do so And this gives our users the opportunity to just explore the graph a little bit more

00:01:52.728 --> 00:01:55.074
by utilizing the back button

00:01:55.074 --> 00:01:58.481
and doing such. So thank you so much!
