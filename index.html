            The under-representation of minorities in the STEM field is a persistent issue that requires attention and innovative solutions. This
            lack of diversity and inclusion hinders innovation, competitiveness,
            and social equity. Our interactive visualization aims to address
            this problem by providing a tool that empowers individuals from
            different backgrounds to explore identify, and ultimately address
            the metrics of employed and unemployed individuals in the STEM
            field.

            Supporting numerous domain tasks such as demographic analysis is critical for promoting
            diversity and inclusion in the STEM workforce. By empowering
            minorities with the tools and information they need to succeed in
            STEM, our visualization can help create a more inclusive, vibrant,
            and sustainable STEM ecosystem. The primary domain tasks
            supported by our visualization are skill mapping and demographic
            analysis. The visualization can be personalized based on the user’s
            input to provide a comprehensive view of the metrics specific to
            the user’s demographic.

            Our visualization aims to create an unfiltered and accurate image of the employment situation in the STEM
            field for the user’s demographic group of interest, taking into account
            the specific state in which they are located. By providing data on the
            actual number of employed individuals, our visualization enables
            users to gain a comprehensive understanding of the employment
            situation in their region. This allows them to make informed decisions and advocate for policies that address the under-representation
            of minorities in STEM fields in their state.

                TODO **PROOFREAD TO MAKE SURE USE CASE IS UP TO DATE**
                A recruiter for a tech company in California is looking to improve
                diversity and inclusion efforts in the company and wants to gain
                a better understanding of the employment situation for minority
                groups in the STEM field in California. The recruiter accesses our
                interactive visualization and selects the ”state” filter, choosing ”California” as the state of interest. Next, they select the ”gender” filter
                and choose ”female”. The visualization updates to show the employment situation for female individuals in the STEM field in California.
                The recruiter sees that the number of employed female individuals
                in the STEM field in California is lower than expected, and the
                unemployment rate is higher than the state average. They then select
                the ”age” filter and choose ”25-34 years old”. The visualization
                updates to show the employment situation for female individuals in
                the STEM field in California in this age group. The recruiter sees
                that the employment situation is even worse for this age group, with
                a higher unemployment rate and lower median salary. They then
                select the ”race” filter and choose ”Black or African American”. The
                visualization updates to show the employment situation for Black
                or African American females in the STEM field in California in the
                25-34 age group. The recruiter sees that the employment situation
                for Black or African American females in the STEM field in California in this age group is particularly challenging, with a significantly
                lower number of employed individuals. Based on the insights gained
                from the visualization, the recruiter can make informed decisions
                and advocate for policies that address the under-representation of
                minority groups in the STEM field in California. By using the visualization to identify areas where additional resources and support are
                needed, the recruiter can create policies that will help create a more
                diverse and inclusive workforce in the STEM field in California.

            <h3>Data</h3>
            <p class = "indented">
                The data used in our visualization is sourced from the National
                Center for Science and Engineering Statistics(NCSES) report titled
                ”Women, Minorities, and Persons with Disabilities in Science and
                Engineering,” which provides comprehensive and detailed data on
                employment metrics in the STEM field. The report presents data
                on various demographics, including race/ethnicity, age, gender, and
                disability status. The employment metrics provided in the report
                are organized by industry, occupation group, and job title and includes information on the educational requirements, job outlook,
                and the median salary for each occupation. Another report we use
                depicts the gender distribution of employed individuals within the
                STEM field by each respective state of the United States. 
            </p>
            <p class = "indented">
                These data are based on a variety of sources, including the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey and the Bureau of Labor
                Statistics’ Current Population Survey. Our visualization combines
                various reports and enables users to interact with this data and explore the employment situation in the STEM field for their specific
                demographic group of interest. Users can filter the data by demographic characteristics, such as race/ethnicity, age, gender, disability
                status, and state. Overall, the data provided in these reports is a valuable resource for understanding the current employment situation
                in the STEM field and identifying areas where additional support
                and resources may be needed to address the under-representation of
                minorities in STEM fields.

                Since much of the data collected through these two studies were compiled
                from United States Census data, as well as through surveys run by
                the NCSES to collect information about college graduates, doctorate
                candidates, and post-secondary education data for students in science
                and engineering, there were certain biases and ethical considerations to 
                pay attention to. Census data has historically posed problems of
                under-counting certain populations, which the studies seem to try and
                mitigate by utilizing multiple sources of information. Additionally,
                the NCSES studies were either called in, or web administered. Since
                most respondents chose to self administer the survey, ad it was
                and web-based, there may be a slight bias towards those with more
                experience and access to technology. However, the surveys are given
                to graduate students, so presumably, there would be less variability
                in their access to these things than there would be in the general
                population.

                (TODO ** DESCRIBE DATA CLEANING, DECIDE WITH GROUP HOW MUCH TO INCLUDE**)
                Since the raw data was also broken up by various demographics, we had to perform extensive data cleaning
                to get it into a form that we could use for our visualization. We chose to narrow down the list
                of occupations we would look at in order to make the visualization clearer, more readable, as well as more feasible to produce. 
                Most of the raw data were in tables, broken down into degree type and occupation by sex, race, and disability status.
                We chose to look at the aggregates of all post-secondary degrees as well. Then, the values were loaded into a CSV...
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                Our data visualization represents a breakdown of the raw data grouped by sex, race, disabilit
                status, and the occupation of each person surveyed. The initial phase of the visualization
                shows the breakdown of total participants by their sex. Then, once a user clicks on the sex
                breakdown they wish to view, the graph will shift to a new bargraph of the counts of people of each
                race that are of the selected sex. The user can then select one of the races by clicking on a bar, as they did before.
                A new bar graph will appear, displaying the counts of people in each disability status, for the 
                people of the selected sex and race. Finally, the user clicks on a disability status, and is led to 
                a final bar graph, showing the number of individuals in the study in each occupation, for the 
                selected sex, race, and disability status. As an example of what the "final" bar graph represents,
                if a user clicks on the bars labelled "Female," then "Asian," and then "With Disability," the fully drilled-down
                bar graph displayed will represent the number of Asian Women With Disabilities in the study for each of the 
                tech-related jobs selected from the study.
