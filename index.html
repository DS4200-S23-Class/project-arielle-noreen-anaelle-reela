        <h2>MOTIVATION</h2>
        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p class="indented">
            The under-representation of minorities in STEM-related field is a persistent issue that requires attention and innovative solutions. This
            lack of diversity and inclusion hinders innovation, competitiveness,
            and social equity. Our interactive visualization aims to address
            this problem by providing a tool that empowers individuals from
            different backgrounds to explore, identify, and ultimately address
            the disproportionate representation of different demographics in STEM-related
            fields. 
        </p> 
        <p class="indented">
            Supporting numerous domain tasks such as demographic analysis is critical for promoting
            diversity and inclusion in the STEM workforce. By empowering
            minorities with the tools and information they need to succeed in
            STEM, our visualization can help create a more inclusive, vibrant,
            and sustainable STEM ecosystem. The primary domain tasks
            supported by our visualization are skill mapping and demographic
            analysis. The visualization can be personalized based on the user's
            input to provide a comprehensive view of the metrics specific to
            the user's demographic. The user can also then make educated decisions about entering their desired field 
            and know the level of diversity to expect.
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
            Our visualization aims to create an unbiased and accurate image of the employment situation in the STEM
            field for the userâ€™s demographic group of interest, taking into account
            their sex, race/ethnic identity, and disability status. Our method of visualizing employement data in STEM-related 
            fields enables users to gain a comprehensive understanding of the employment
            situation in their demographic group of interest in the United States. This allows them to make informed decisions and advocate for
             policies that address the under-representation
            of minorities in STEM fields in the United States.
        </p>
        <div id = "use_case">
            <h4>Use Case</h4>
            <p>
                An example use case for our visualization project is as follows: 
                <br>
                <p class = 'shifted'>
       
                    A recruiter (she/her) for a tech company in California is looking to improve
                    diversity and inclusion efforts in the company and wants to gain
                    a better understanding of the employment situation for minority
                    groups in the STEM field in California. The recruiter accessing our
                    interactive visualization begins with the first chart. 
                    This chart shows the male/female distribution of people in STEM-related fields within each race/ethnic group.
                    The recruiter is very interested to see that in all the race/ethnic groups, males are far more represented. 
                    She is also interested to see that Native Hawaiian's have quite low employement 
                    counts in the STEM-field comapred to the other race/ethnic groups.
                    She continues to explore, clicking on the "female" bar of the Native-Hawaiian group.
                    The recruiter is brought to another chart, showing employement metrics across different STEM jobs for only Native Hawaiian women.
                    She is excited to see that her field, Social Scientist, is listed as a bar, so she hovers over it, 
                    and is disappointed to see that the representation of 
                    non-disabled individuals is far higher than that of disabled individuals. Upon clicking the bars, she is able to view the proportions of 
                    disabled individuals to non-disabled individuals in the form of a pie chart.
                    She does some comparison between her field and the other fields listed. 
                    Based on the insights gained from the visualization, the recruiter can make informed decisions
                    and advocate for policies that address the under-representation of
                    minority groups, such as Native-Hawaiian disabled women in this example, in her field. 
                    By using the visualization to identify areas where additional resources and support are
                    needed, the recruiter can create policies that will help create a more
                    diverse and inclusive workforce in the STEM field.

            <h3>Data</h3>
            <h4>Source</h4>
            <p class = "indented">  
                The data used in our visualization is sourced from the National
                Center for Science and Engineering Statistics(NCSES) report titled
                "Women, Minorities, and Persons with Disabilities in Science and
                Engineering," which provides comprehensive and detailed data on
                employment metrics in the STEM field. The report presents data
                on various demographics, including race/ethnicity, age, gender, and
                disability status. The employment metrics provided in the report
                are organized by industry, occupation group, and job title and includes information on the educational requirements, job outlook,
                and the median salary for each occupation. Another report we use
                depicts the gender distribution of employed individuals within the
                STEM field by each respective state of the United States. 
            </p>
            <p class = "indented">
                These data are based on a variety of sources, including the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey and the Bureau of Labor
                Statistics' Current Population Survey. Our visualization combines
                various reports and enables users to interact with this data and explore the employment situation in the STEM field for their specific
                demographic group of interest. Users can filter the data by demographic characteristics, such as race/ethnicity, age, gender, disability
                status, and state. Overall, the data provided in these reports is a valuable resource for understanding the current employment situation
                in the STEM field and identifying areas where additional support
                and resources may be needed to address the under-representation of
                minorities in STEM fields.
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                Since much of the data collected through these two studies were compiled
                from United States Census data, as well as through surveys run by
                the NCSES to collect information about college graduates, doctorate
                candidates, and post-secondary education data for students in science
                and engineering, there were certain biases and ethical considerations to 
                pay attention to. Census data has historically posed problems of
                under-counting certain populations, which the studies seem to try and
                mitigate by utilizing multiple sources of information. Additionally,
                the NCSES studies were either called in, or web administered. Since
                most respondents chose to self administer the survey, ad it was
                and web-based, there may be a slight bias towards those with more
                experience and access to technology. However, the surveys are given
                to graduate students, so presumably, there would be less variability
                in their access to these things than there would be in the general
                population.target="_blank"
            </p>
            
            <p class = "indented">
                The tables used were table 9-5 Employed scientists and engineers, by occupation, highest degree level, and sex: 2019, 9-6 Employed scientists and engineers, by highest degree level, occupation, ethnicity, and race: 2019,
                and 9-8 Employed scientists and engineers, by occupation, highest degree level, and disability status: 2019.

            <br>
            <h4>Data Cleaning</h4>
            <p class = "indented">
                Since the raw data was also broken up by various demographics, we had to perform extensive data cleaning
                to get it into a form that we could use for our visualization. We chose to narrow down the list
                of occupations we would look at in order to make the visualization clearer, more readable, as well as more feasible to produce. 
                Most of the raw data were in tables, broken down into degree type and occupation by sex, race, and disability status.
                We chose to look at the aggregates of all post-secondary degrees as well. The data was presented as hierarchal tables not suitable
                for data processing. We decided on a structure of a data table that would include the counts of each demographical combination within a 
                occupation and used the data tables of our sources to populate our table. For example, a row in our final data table 
                had several columns representing Sex, Occupation, Race, and Disability status, and then based on the three tables shown above,
                we performed calculations to get the approximate number of individuals in the study that had that combination of traits (ex: 
                Female, Asian, With Disability, Social Scientist would produce approximately 1747.117227 individuals).
                We then converted the information from our Excel data table to a JSON structure to 
                to support our visualization.
            </p>
            
            <h4>High-Level Visualization Description</h4>
            <p class="indented">
                The initial phase of the visualization shows the breakdown of people in STEM related fields for each race/ethnic group by their sex, male or female. 
                Upon clicking the bar representing the sex-group for the race the user wants to view, the visualization will shift,
                now showing the employment metrics for people of the chosen race and sex, broken down into their respective disibility status counts for each STEM-field occupation.
                Thus, this final bar graph represents the counts of individuals in each occupation with the selected race and sex, comparing the number of those with disabilites,
                and those without. The final bar graph gives way to a pie chart when the bars are clicked, providing an alternate view of the 
                proportion of disabled and non-disabled staus in the chosen occupation,race, and sex. To go back to the original chart at any stage, you can click the "BACK BUTTON."
